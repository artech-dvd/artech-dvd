## Hello! Welcome to my GitHub :-)

I'm a 14 y/o M (he/him), (mostly) amateur software developer mainly looking to use my skills in aiding in restoration and archival projects of old and obscure tech.

Ironically, I don't have much on my GitHub yet, since most of my recent programming projects were made entirely by myself.

I _do_ have a (albeit, very '90s-looking) website [here](https://artech.neocities.org/). (Don't take the buttons too seriously, they're just some semi-ironic ones I made in Piskel for fun. ;-) The background for the main page is a 1971 IBM 3277 Model 1 terminal; the frame is made entirely with a [single border image](https://artech.neocities.org/border.png) and CSS (`border-image-*` properties).

**Stuff I've Contributed To:**

* [The Old ROBLOX ClientSearch](https://clientsearch.tumblr.com/) (Council Member, Archivist); helped find and contact various old ROBLOX players from 2005-2006 for versions from that era.
* [The Block Coding Archive](https://tbca.nukley.com/) (Co-Owner/Manager, Archivist); helped find various old versions and pre-release prototypes of Scratch from 2003-2009 and document them on the [Scratch Wiki](https://en.scratch-wiki.info/).

**Personal Projects:**

* Learning (teaching myself) [Intel 4004](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_4004) assembly. Not much here yet, expect more soon. (A few programs done, nothing useful yet)
* Writing my own programming language and interpreter. Same as above. (Preliminary, functional proof-of-concept code done)
* [`mol-emu`](https://github.com/artech-dvd/mol-emu/) and [`nls-emu`](https://github.com/artech-dvd/nls-emu/). Both more-or-less abandoned projects attempting to restore Douglas Engelbart's 1969 [NLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NLS_(computer_system)) from various [source code scans](https://bitsavers.org/pdf/sri/arc/sds-940/NLS_Sources_Part_1_Nov69.pdf) and [manuals](https://bitsavers.org/pdf/sri/arc/sds-940/NLS_System_Guide_19691021.pdf), along with its proprietary [MOL-940 compiler](https://bitsavers.org/pdf/sri/arc/rulifson/MOL940_Preliminary_Specification_For_An_Algol-Like_Machine_Oriented_Language_For_The_SDS_940_Mar68.pdf) by reimplementing it in [YACC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yacc)/[Lex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lex_(software)) (aka GNU [Bison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Bison)/[Flex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flex_(lexical_analyser_generator))).
* A raytracer in 2003 Scratch. I was eventually (c. Feb/Mar 2024) able to implement an _incredibly_ slow (a bit over 0.5px/sec), very basic raytracer in a [2003 version of Scratch](https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/Scratch_11Oct03) (screenshot [here](https://artech.neocities.org/raytracer.png), project file [here](https://www.mediafire.com/file/wz9q3g5v6bp0yev/raytracer-final-final.scratch/file)).
* Running [IRIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRIX) on a Chromebook. I was successful in initially doing this around December 2020 and [posted a photo of it on Reddit in mid-2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/IRIX/comments/o4bt0q/irix_on_a_chromebook/).

**More Stuff About Me:**

* I've been programming for over 8 years, since I was 6 years old! I made my first Scratch project on my own around April 2016.
* Consequently, I've also been on Scratch for [over 8 years](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/danielgle/), although didn't share any of my first projects.
* I've been using Linux for over 6 years (since February 2018); specifically, [Raspbian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspbian) on a [Raspberry Pi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi) Model 3B.
* I've been on the Scratch Wiki for [about 4 years](https://en.scratch-wiki.info/w/index.php?title=User:Retro_person&action=history), and [wrote the initial Scratch11Oct03 article](https://en.scratch-wiki.info/w/index.php?title=Scratch_11Oct03&oldid=316319) (based off the existing [14Feb04](https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/Scratch_14Feb04) article). I've also contributed several sections to the [Scratch 1.0](https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/Development_of_Scratch_1.0) and [2.0 development pages](https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/Development_of_Scratch_2.0).
* I first learned to program in an assembly(-esque) language around 2021 by writing programs for a 1977 [TI-57 programmable calculator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-57). However, it has no permanent memory and no data I/O (other than the keypad and screen), so unfortunately I don't have any of my programs. I recall one of my favorites being a number guessing game, which would tell you if your guess was higher or lower and track your points.
* I actually [had a previous GitHub account](https://web.archive.org/web/20210325003620/github.com/retro-person) I made in 2020! However, since I was under 13 at the time (therefore against [ToS](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service)), I was banned. I had a few cool projects on there, including a Scratch 1.4 mod called KitKat (later KoolKode) written in [Squeak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squeak) (I reuploaded a few versions of the mod [here](https://www.mediafire.com/folder/4px3x3qgjm2z7/KitKat-KoolKode_Versions)).

**More Random Interesting Stuff...**

* The [first (known) executed computer program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_Baby#First_programs) has actually been [scanned](http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/CCS/Archive/misc/hcf1.gif).
* The source code to (arguably) the [first 3D platformer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_Waves) has been [released](https://web.archive.org/web/20150812145405/http://cc3d.free.fr/Alpha-Waves.zip).
* The first graphical programming language was invented by [William Sutherland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bert_Sutherland) in 1966, and was [video-demoed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLyIYmPfCps) on the MIT [TX-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TX-2) computer.
* The Intel 4004 was _not_ the first microprocessor! There are several contenders; namely the 1971 8-bit [TI TMX 1795](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microprocessor#Texas_Instruments_TMX_1795_(1970%E2%80%931971)), the 1971 ([RISC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computer)!) [GI PICO1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microprocessor#Pico/General_Instrument_(1971)), and perhaps even the 1969 [Four-Phase Systems AL1](https://www.cpushack.com/2014/08/15/four-phase-systems-al1-processor-8-bits-by-lee-boysel/), although the last one's claim as a "single-chip CPU" is [debatable](https://www.righto.com/2015/05/the-texas-instruments-tmx-1795-first.html#:~:text=MOS/LSI%20processors.-,Four%2DPhase%20AL1,-If%20one%20person).

That's about it for now. More to come soon!
